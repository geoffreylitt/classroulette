Yale Classroulette
==================

This is a small Sinatra project that displays the Yale University course catalog in a beautiful, randomized way. It uses the great JQuery Isotope with some custom modifications to display the courses.

The code is not pretty and should not be interpreted as my idea of clean code ;)
